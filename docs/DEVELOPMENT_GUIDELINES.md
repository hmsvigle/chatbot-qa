# Development Guidelines & Release Management

## 📋 Core Development Rules

### **1. Version Control & Testing**
- ✅ Test every release change before committing
- ✅ Each release must have local test code for validation
- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility for demonstration purposes
- ✅ Document execution steps for each release

### **2. Environment Management** 
- ✅ Use UV package manager consistently across all releases
- ✅ Use same virtual environment (.venv) for all releases
- ✅ Maintain environment consistency for reproducible results

### **3. Documentation Standards**
- ✅ **README.md**: Theoretical steps and concepts for each release
- ✅ **TECHNICAL.md**: Detailed technical documentation per phase
- ✅ **Local Test Files**: Release-specific testing (not committed to git)
- ✅ **Execution Documentation**: Step-by-step release demonstration guide

### **4. Release Demonstration Strategy**
- ✅ Ability to switch back to previous releases for comparison
- ✅ Version-aware system supporting multiple operational modes
- ✅ Documented execution steps for each phase/release
- ✅ Performance benchmarks and improvement metrics

### **5. Internal Reference System**
- ✅ Internal documentation can reference external resources
- ✅ Keep git repository focused on core project content
- ✅ Technical implementation details in separate technical docs

## 🏗️ Release Management Framework

### **Release Structure**
```
Release X/
├── Core Implementation
├── Local Test Files (not committed)
├── Technical Documentation
├── Execution Steps Documentation
└── Backward Compatibility Layer
```

### **Documentation Hierarchy**
1. **README.md** - Theoretical overview of all releases
2. **PHASE_X_TECHNICAL.md** - Technical implementation details
3. **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md** - This file (internal reference)
4. **Local test files** - Release validation (not in git)

### **Testing Protocol**
1. Validate current release functionality
2. Test backward compatibility with previous releases
3. Document performance improvements/changes
4. Create local demonstration scripts
5. Update execution documentation

## 🔄 Version Management Implementation

### **Current Architecture**
- Version-aware system using SystemPhase enum
- Configuration-based mode switching
- Backward compatibility preservation
- Performance tracking across releases

### **Future Release Planning**
- Each major change will have documented execution steps
- Demonstration capabilities for all previous releases
- Technical documentation per phase
- Local testing framework per release

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### **README.md Content**
- Project purpose and educational objectives
- Theoretical concepts and architecture patterns
- High-level feature overview per release
- Quick start and basic execution steps

### **Technical Documentation Content**
- Implementation details and code structure
- API specifications and data structures
- Performance optimization techniques
- Deployment and configuration details

### **Internal Reference Rules**
- Can reference external resources and documentation
- Keep implementation-specific details out of main README
- Focus on practical execution and demonstration steps
- Technical depth belongs in dedicated technical docs

This framework ensures consistent development practices while maintaining demonstration capabilities across all releases.
